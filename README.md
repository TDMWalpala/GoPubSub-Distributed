## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Replace `<port>` with the desired port number (e.g., 5000).

### Running the Clients

#### Client in Publisher Mode

To run the client in publisher mode, use the following command:

Replace `<serverIP>` and `<serverPort>` with the IP address and port number of the server.
